## Projects

### 1. Web Scraping
- Scraped program information from a website using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- Exported results to CSV.
- Demonstrates challenges with dynamic JavaScript-driven content.

### 2. Text Preprocessing & Data Augmentation
- Preprocessed tweets: cleaned, lowercased, and removed noise.
- Used a pre-trained **Word2Vec** model to insert semantically similar words.
- Augmented dataset size by 2x.

### 3. Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis
- Classified tweets using **positive/negative word lexicons**.
- Calculated sentiment scores (% positive vs % negative words).
- Evaluated model â†’ **Accuracy ~46%, F1 Score ~47%**.
- Output results to CSV.
